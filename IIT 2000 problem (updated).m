### Kinematics problem of IIT (2000)
#### This is an interesting problem of kinematics from IIT (2000), it is slightly different from normal problems that we come across. Therefore I thought doing a video explaining and solving this problem will certainly help people grasp kinematics properly. I have also added a small animation for better understanding the problem.
